"NOTE: Updated population controls are introduced annually with the release of January data. Effective with January 2020 data, occupations reflect the
introduction of the 2018 Census occupational classification system into the Current Population Survey, or household survey. This classification system is derived
from the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). No historical data have been revised. Data for 2020 are not strictly comparable with earlier years.",,,,,,
